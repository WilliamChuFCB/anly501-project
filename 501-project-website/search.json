    "text": "About Me\nHi! I am Wendi Chu, a graduate student of DSAN program. I come from China and my undergraduate school is Tongji University in Shanghai. I studied statistics during my undergraduate period, thus I have used a lot of statistical modeling methods to process different types of data. My dream is to work as a data scientist in a big tech company and thatâ€™s why I am studying in this program to get more familiar with the world of data science. During spare time, I am a crazy fan of soccer. My favorite sport star is Messi, who is one of the greatest soccer players of all time. I also love to join many other sports, ranging from basketball, table tennis to swimming and cycling. Additionally, I enjoy playing the guitar and listening to pop music. Feel free to contact me through WeChat or email."

    "text": "My first exposure to data science\nMy first exposure to data science occurred three years ago when my professor recommended me some courses on Coursera by Andrew Ng about deep neural networks. It was extremely fascinating to see how the use of data was able to simulate and generate insights to many aspects of the world we live in. More specifically, as a soccer fan, I was impressed when I learned that the success rate of goal kick can be roughly estimated by the placement of the ball. Driven by my curiosity and interest, I finished several Coursera courses in succession, including Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Network, and Hyperparameter tuning. Submerged in the world of data, I felt as if I was a magician when I constructed different neural network models to recognize a cat or detect a car from multiple pictures. This experience was the start of my journey to the world of data science and I dream to use these data science methods to bring tangible benefits to certain fields, such as facilitating the improvement of techniques and tactics of the soccer team in my country or promoting the image recognition accuracy of self-driving vehicles."
