    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <h2>Topic</h2>

    <p style="font-size:15px;">My topic is about the relationship between transportation level and economic development as well as residents’ well-being. I will focus on a series of subtopics like how different modes of transportation affect economic development and how proportion of public transport relate to people’s well-being.</p>

    <h2>Interpretion</h2>

    <p style="font-size:15px;">As is known to all, transportation is crutial for a country’s development. For instance, domestic cargo transportation depends on railway and highway traffic while international transport heavily depends on shipping. It is obvious that transportation level of a region has relationship with its economic development. But the key point is how the transportation effect the economy and which means of transportation play the biggest role. Also, what is the standard to measure a region’s transportation level? Vehicle population or highway mileage? But we know that increasing number of automobiles cause heavy traffic jam, which affect residents’ well-being. This leads to another hypothesis-does proportion of public transportation relates to people’s well-being? These all need further data analysis to answer.</p>
    
    <h2>Questions</h2>

    <p style="font-size:15px;">There are 10 questions highly related to my topic which will be answered by this project.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Which mode of transportation relates most to a state’s or a country’s economic development?</li>
        <li>Whether the government's investment in transportation has positive correlation to the level of economic development?</li>
        <li>Which modes of transportation can be profitable for governments and which can not?</li>
        <li>How and which parameters can we use to measure a region’s transportation level?</li>
        <li>What factors will effect a region’s transportation level besides government’s investment?</li>
        <li>Does transportation level of a state have positive correlation to the state’s GDP?</li>
        <li>How the proportion of public transportation differs from region to region?</li>
        <li>What is the relationship between a region’s proportion of public transportation and degree of traffic congestion?</li>
        <li>Does the diversity of public transport modes relates to residents’ well-being?</li>
        <li>Whether a region’s transportation level has positive correlation to residents’ well-being?</li>
      </ol>
