    "According to all the analysis and discussion in this study, I am more able to answer the data science questions proposed at the beginning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Travel time, terminal waiting time, vehicle cost, household income are all important factors contribute to people’s choice of transportation mode. Among these variables, travel time seems to have the highest relationship with the travel mode choice. After the statistical analysis, travel group size are not as important as other factors mentioned above. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for people’s comments on the Internet, it is absolutely that people’s vocabulary use varies a lot towards different types of transportation. Additionally, the sentiment of the tweets also seems to be different. For example, the average sentiment of tweets shows that comments about “metro” tend to be more neutral compared to those about “freeway”.\n",

    "Since COVID-19 pandemic broke in 2020, the total ridership and turnover of public transportation drop significantly according to the US Monthly Transportation Statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this study shows that it is possible to utilize different kinds of machine learning algorithms to predict people’s travel mode choice based on the passengers’ travel information. This may be used in companies of transportation industry. For instance, those companies can obtain uses’s data about travel habit and other travel information through their APPs. Then, they can establish a series of data models to automatically recommend the optimal travel choice that takes time, money, convenience and travel habits in an integrated consideration, which might elevate users’ travel experience."
