    "## Introduction of data gathering\n",
    "\n",
    "Data gathering is known as the process to collect and analyze data from various sources in order to find answers to data science problems. In this page, I will introduce the whole process of gathering valuable data for this project, ranging from the raw data source to basic images that illustrates these datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transportation is a relatively big and abstract topic. In order to answer the data science questions about this topic, I need to find different kinds of datasets. The first dimension is different types of data. To be specific, there are many different types of datasets, including labeled data, qualitative data, quantitative data, temporal data, text data, Geo data, etc. This study will cover three different types: record data, text data and temporal data. The second dimension is different scales of data. It is known to all, transportation is so important that it not only influences the life of every single person, but plays a big role in a country's macro-economy as well. Therefore, to systematically understanding the role of transportation, it is appropriate to use both \"big scale data\" about economy and government and \"small scale data\" about citizens and everyday life at the same time."
